What is this strange symbol of serpent and goblet? A mythical rune of the Druids? Perhaps something from an Arthurian legend? No! In fact this is known as the [Bowl of Hygieia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_of_Hygieia) and serves as the official symbol of pharmaceutical professional.

Of course its origin really is from mythology - Greek in fact. But it is an interesting sight to see this ancient device still in use in the very modern field of pharmacology. This particular rendition is lovingly hand-crafted in green and black thread on a white onesie. The perfect pullover for the prodigy of a person of the pharmacy persuasion.
