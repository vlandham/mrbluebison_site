h3. About

One of the most ancient of symbols in the collective memory of man, the snake is both a creator and a destructor - depending on which end you are looking at. In the Christian world, Satan is embodied as a serpant when decieving his human hosts in the garden of Eden. While in Indian mythology, the king of serpants was paramount in the fabled 'Churing of the Ocean of Milk', from which all mortal life sprung. The primitive look of this wood-block print is a response to the ancient and primitive nature of the subject matter. 

The primitive nature of the cutting is also due to Jim having no idea what he was doing when attempting to create this piece. It was hewn from a hacked portion of lumber, using unsharped chisels. Its a wonder nobody lost an eye in the process.
