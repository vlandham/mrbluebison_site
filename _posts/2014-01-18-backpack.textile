h3. About

As our first born starts down the long and complex adventure that is _school_ we try to teach her the basics: stay positive, stay smart, and stay trendy.

To facilitate that final point, Bethany selflessly engineered this marvel of a school bag - just the right size for a toddler. 

Using a wonderfully detailed pattern from "Made by RAE":http://www.made-by-rae.com/2009/03/finally-here-toddler-backpack-pattern/ , this hand-crafted beauty features padded straps, a vintage zipper, and piggies! 

This certainly would have been the most fashionable of toddler accessories in the entire school. Unfortunately, the book-bag requirements for the particular institution she attended mandated a larger sized variety. Oh well, now at least her dolls have something to wear.
