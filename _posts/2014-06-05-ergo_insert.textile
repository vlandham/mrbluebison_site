Now everybody likes the Ergo right? But its a bummer that you have to wait months before your baby is old enough to use one. Wouldn't it be great if you could jam a newborn in one? Well, now you can!

Introducing the custom Ergo insert! Now you can turn yourself into a bulky human kangaroo - no matter how tiny your little joey happens to be.
