_"Will man travel in space?"_ This is the title of the cigarette card from 1935 that inspired this print of a futuristic rocketship from the past. I found a [digital copy of this card](http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?trg=1&strucID=222694&imageID=407623&word=man%20space&s=1&notword=&d=&c=&f=&k=0&lWord=&lField=&sScope=&sLevel=&sLabel=&total=6&num=0&imgs=20&pNum=&pos=1) in the [NYPL Digital Gallery](http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/index.cfm). The back of the card gives a little hint as to the aspirations of the future man of the past:

    > It does not seem likely that man, as his power grows, will be content to confine his activities for ever to the earth. In ships, perhaps like this, and impelled by the power of the atom, he will voyage in space and perhaps plant himself upon other planets. The time may come when he is forced to do so, for the sun may cool.
