h3. About

Commissioned to commemorate the welcoming of our second born into the world. 

This bag was hand crafted by his loving mother and served wonderfully as a hospital go bag. It was prepped and ready to go weeks before the event (even though he was technically two weeks early - she was ready for him). 

The pattern comes from the ever wonderful and talented "Noodlehead":http://www.noodle-head.com/2013/10/cargo-duffle-pattern-for-robert-kaufman.html?m=1 . This cargo duffel bag was porting the provisions to provide after producing new life into this world - a ponderous purpose, I'm sure you'll agree.
