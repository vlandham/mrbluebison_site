h3. About

Upon first spotting this rabbit, your eye is drawn to its leanness. Its bold, rough symmetry. Its perfect, God-like form. This is not the rabbit from your childhood bed-time stories: cautious, creeping, conniving. No, this is a Spartan rabbit - in the very true sense of the word. This rabbit takes what he wants. This rabbit's tracks are marked by a confident, conspicuous canter. The stories told about this rabbit are those not meant for children's ears: ones of blood, fear, and conquest.

On a different note, this was Bethany's first screenprint - marking our introduction into the wonderful world of the superfluous adornment of outerwear.
