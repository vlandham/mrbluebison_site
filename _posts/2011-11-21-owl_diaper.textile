h3. About

Surprising to no one, babies are not all just full of soft coos and warm smiles. In fact, for the first 18 months or so, some babies are full of everything but those things. 

And by full of things - I mean they poop. 

And so, my wife's expert hand went towards the crafting of receptacles for this unflattering, but unsurprising baby side-effect. 

The owl diaper is now just one of a multitude of similarly attractive and carefully constructed poop catchers. The rational, I am supposing, is that anything worth doing - is worth doing right. And by doing, again, I mean poop.
