h3. About

My first book! And I even vanity printed it. You can "buy it on amazon":http://www.amazon.com/Zia-Woods-Jimmy-Vallandingham/dp/1494986094/ or even get a "pdf version":http://ziainthewoods.com/ . 

Of course, most of the credit should go directly to the wonderfully talented "Victoria Grace Elliott":http://www.balderdashcomic.com/ who created the illustrations for this little story. I just made up some words and stuck them next to the full color imagery she conjured forth.
