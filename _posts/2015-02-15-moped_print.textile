h3. About

A little experiment that was a bit too hastily cut to call art. An interpretation of my 1983 "Suzuki FA50":http://www.mopedarmy.com/wiki/Suzuki_FA50 aka the Suzuki Shuttle. But, in a way I'm a bit sentimental about this piece - a farewell to the moped I loved so dearly. 

I didn't really have the time or the geographical location to be mopeding much - so when the time came to leave Kansas City for the greener pastures of Seattle, I couldn't justify to myself (or more importantly to my wife) bringing it along. 

With a heavy heart, I sent my friend to where all good mopeds go - to that great big craigslist in the sky (or just in Kansas City). I hope it still thinks of me as much as I of it.
